# Chitter
Chitter is a social media application that allows a user to post a 'cluck' and view the feed of other users' clucks. 

# The Team
Naomi Starr & Natalie Theodoropoulou

# The Stack
We decided to use the MERN stack (Mongo DB Atlas, Express, Reach, NodeJS). 

# Planning

We started out with an Excalidraw to map out the whole application. We then created a <a href="https://trello.com/b/tEYld7gC/chitter-challenge">Trello board</a> to organise all our tickets.
